ca_culture_fereldan_mabari_desc_1;Mabari Warhounds are both beloved pets and the fiercesome vanguard of the Fereldan Army. These Hounds are prized for their loyalty, intelligence and strength, relied upon to deal devastating damage to any invading force, or to simply protect their masters. Fereldan tradition means that Mabari can be found all across the country, used for everything from hunting to beasts of burden in the mountains, and are generally treated very kindly by the general populace. Whilst Orlais might sneer that the country stinks of wet dog, no Fereldan noble or commoner would deny that the Mabari is a symbol of national pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
